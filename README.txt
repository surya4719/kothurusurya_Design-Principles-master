Epam Home Task-3 Design Principles.

Implementing Design principles in the Calculator App.
SOLID principle:
-->Single Responsibility Principle: The App class has only one responsibility to take inut and give the resulant output.
-->Open Closed Principle: Software entities are open for extension, but closed for modification.
--> Liskov Substitution Principle: The new derived classes (Add,Sub..) are extending the base classes Mathcommand without changing their behavior
--> Interface segregation principle: Users are not forced to implement the methods Expo() and Modulus() as they donâ€™t use.
--> Dependency Inversion: High level modules are not depending on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
KISS Principle:
-->Each method solves one small problems, not many use cases. The methods are very small.
DRY Principle:
-->The abstract methods are used as Helper Class,Enterprise Libraries.
YAGNI:
-->When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements.
